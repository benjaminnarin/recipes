# Simple Mac and Cheese

Based on recipe from [here](https://www.seriouseats.com/ingredient-stovetop-mac-and-cheese-recipe)

## Ingredients

* Elbow Macaroni
* Salt
* 6 oz Evaporated Milk
* 6 oz cheese (but to be honest use as much as you want)
* Any extra ingredients (chicken,sausage,)

## Instructions

1. Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.

2. Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.

3. Add any extra ingredients.
